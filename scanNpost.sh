# This command attempts to find the first non-loopback IPv4 address.
# Adjust the parsing if your environmentâ€™s ifconfig output differs.

# Using an external service to get your public IP address.

# --- Create JSON Payload ---
# We build a JSON string containing both IP addresses.

# --- Send the Data via POST ---
# The -H flag sets the content type to JSON.
